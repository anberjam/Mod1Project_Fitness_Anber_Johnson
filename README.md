This application serves as a platform to discover new exercises and add to your workout routine. It is intended for users who are new to the workout world and need exposure on what exercises work out specific muscles.

When you first enter the app, it greets you with the logo and asks whether you are a returning member or a new member. If you are a returning member, you can log into the app with your username and password. If you a new member, you first must create a username and password. You cannot choose a pre-existing username. 

Once you are logged in, you are asked if you want to add to your workout plan, see current workout plan, or return to the main menu. You can browse through general body parts and specific muscles. Each muscle has three workouts listed, and you have the option to add the exercises to your workout plan. 

You can go to the main menu and choose "My current workout plan" to see your saved exercises. You can further update your workout plan by inputting the exercise numbers that you would like to delete.
